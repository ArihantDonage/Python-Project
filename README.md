This Python script creates a PyQt-based GUI application that monitors system network activity and provides details about active processes using `psutil`. Here's a breakdown of the code, restructured for clarity and better understanding:

To install `psutil`, `metaplot`, and `pyqt5`, follow these steps:

### 1. **Open Command Prompt or Terminal**
   Ensure you have Python and `pip` installed. If not, install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and make sure to add it to your system's PATH during installation.

### 2. **Install psutil**

`psutil` is a Python library that provides information on system utilization (CPU, memory, disks, network, sensors).

   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

### 3. **Install metaplot**

To install `metaplot`, run the following command. This library may not be as commonly available as others, so ensure it is available in the `pip` repositories or from GitHub. If it's not found in `pip`, you may need to download it manually or clone the GitHub repository.

   ```bash
   pip install metaplot
   ```

   If itâ€™s not found, search for the repository or try the exact package name or URL:

   ```bash
   pip install git+https://github.com/username/metaplot.git
   ```

### 4. **Install PyQt5**

PyQt5 is the GUI framework library:

   ```bash
   pip install PyQt5
   ```

### 5. **Verify Installation**

After installation, you can check if the packages are installed correctly by opening a Python console and importing them:

```python
import psutil
import PyQt5
import metaplot  # If installed successfully
```

If there are no errors, the packages have been installed successfully.
### 1. **Imports and Initialization**
   - **PyQt5**: Used to create the graphical user interface (GUI).
   - **psutil**: Library to access system and process information (CPU, memory, network).
   - **matplotlib**: Used to plot real-time graphs of network usage.
   - **uic**: Loads .ui files created by Qt Designer.
   - **Global variables**:
     - `oldSendBytes` and `oldRecvBytes`: Track previously sent and received bytes to calculate data transfer rates.
     - `plotSend` and `plotRecv`: Store network traffic data for plotting.

### 2. **`Widget` Class (Main Window)**
   - **`__init__()`**: Initializes the main window and sets up UI elements.
     - Loads the main UI design from a file (`main.ui`).
     - Creates instances of two sub-widgets: `processInfoWidget` and `processStatistickWidget`.
     - Sets up context menus, timers, and signals for the list widgets (UI components that display data).

   - **Context Menu for List Widget**:
     - Right-click on items in `listWidget_3` to display a context menu with two options: "Show process info" and "Show process statistics."
     - Both options trigger corresponding functions (`menuItemClicked()` and `menuItem2Clicked()`).

   - **Timers**:
     - `self.timer`: Refreshes network statistics every 2 seconds.
     - `self.timefForGraph`: Refreshes the network graph every 1 second.
   
   - **`graph()` Function**:
     - Real-time plotting of sent (`plotSend`) and received (`plotRecv`) bytes over time using `matplotlib`.
     - Graph data is refreshed at 1-second intervals.
     
   - **Network Interfaces**:
     - `interfacesListSet()`: Populates the list of available network interfaces.
     - `networkStatistickProcess()`: Displays network statistics for each process in a table.

### 3. **Context Menu Handling**
   - **Right-click event on `listWidget_3`**:
     - Displays options to view process info or statistics.
     - **`menuItemClicked()`**: Displays details like current working directory, status, executable path, command line arguments, etc.
     - **`menuItem2Clicked()`**: Displays statistics such as memory and CPU usage for the selected process.

### 4. **Process Management**
   - The `processInfoWidget` and `processStatistickWidget` classes handle detailed process information and real-time statistics.
   - **`killingProcess()`**: Allows the user to kill a process.
   - **`suspendProcess()`/`resumeProcess()`**: Suspend or resume a process.

### 5. **Real-time Graphing of Network Traffic and Process Stats**
   - The application generates live graphs for:
     - **Network traffic** (bytes sent/received) for the selected network interface.
     - **CPU and memory usage** for the selected process in the `processStatistickWidget`.

### Code Behavior Summary:
1. Displays real-time network statistics (bytes sent/received).
2. Lists active processes with network activity in `listWidget_3`.
3. Right-clicking a process brings up options to view process info or statistics.
4. Real-time graphs show network traffic and system resource usage (CPU, memory) for individual processes.

### Key Features:
- **Real-time Monitoring**: The GUI tracks and displays live system stats.
- **Interactive Process Management**: You can suspend, resume, or kill processes.
- **Graphical Plots**: Uses `matplotlib` to plot real-time data.

Feel free to ask if you need further clarification on any specific part of the code!
